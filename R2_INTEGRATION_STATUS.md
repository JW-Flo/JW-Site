# R2 Bucket Storage Integration Status

## Summary

- R2 bucket endpoints (`/functions/r2/upload`, `/functions/r2/download`, `/functions/r2/delete`, `/functions/r2/list`) are implemented and expect the `MEDIA` binding.
- No API routes, UI components, or scripts in the main application currently call or reference these endpoints.
- No evidence of file upload, download, or object listing functionality exposed to users or used internally.
- The R2 endpoints are ready for use but are not integrated into the user experience or backend workflows.

## Recommendation

- To enable R2 storage features, add API routes or UI components that interact with the R2 endpoints.
- See the next section for a suggested integration path.

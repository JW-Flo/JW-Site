# AtlasWeave: Dynamic Workflow Orchestration for IT Automation

## Overview

AtlasWeave is a sophisticated workflow orchestration platform designed specifically for IT operations, featuring a proprietary FlowWeave format and visual NexusCanvas designer. Unlike traditional workflow systems, AtlasWeave combines the power of low-code visual design with enterprise-grade execution capabilities.

## Core Philosophy

**"Don't just name it after Okta - reinvent workflow automation"**

AtlasWeave takes inspiration from identity platforms like Okta but goes beyond simple workflow automation by providing:

- **Proprietary FlowWeave Format**: A JSON-based workflow specification that's both human-readable and machine-optimized
- **Dynamic Component System**: Like Okta's workflow cards but with extensible, programmable components
- **Referenceable Resources**: Direct integration with IT systems, users, groups, and data sources
- **Advanced Expression Engine**: IFTTT-style operators with full JavaScript expression support
- **Visual NexusCanvas Designer**: Drag-and-drop workflow creation with intelligent auto-layout

## Architecture

### FlowWeave Format

The FlowWeave format is the heart of AtlasWeave, providing a declarative way to define complex IT workflows:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Enterprise User Onboarding",
    "description": "Complete user onboarding with multi-system integration"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "hr-system",
      "type": "system",
      "name": "HR Management System",
      "config": {
        "baseUrl": "{{systems.hr.apiUrl}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "flows": [
    {
      "id": "user-onboarding-main",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "create-ad-user",
          "type": "action",
          "config": {
            "componentId": "ad-user-management"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Component System

AtlasWeave features a rich component library with pre-built components for common IT operations:

#### Identity & Access Management
- **AD User Management**: Create, update, disable Active Directory accounts
- **O365 License Management**: Assign/remove Office 365 licenses
- **AWS IAM Management**: Configure AWS user permissions
- **Slack User Management**: Manage Slack workspace access

#### Communication & Collaboration
- **Notification Sender**: Multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, Teams)
- **Approval Workflow**: Configurable approval processes with escalation

#### Data Processing
- **Data Transformer**: Map, filter, aggregate data between systems
- **Expression Engine**: Advanced conditional logic and data manipulation

### NexusCanvas Visual Designer

The NexusCanvas provides a drag-and-drop interface for workflow creation:

- **Visual Node-Based Editor**: Intuitive drag-and-drop workflow design
- **Auto-Layout Engine**: Automatic workflow optimization and layout
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on workflow issues
- **Component Discovery**: Browse and add components from the library

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Proprietary FlowWeave Format
Unlike Okta's closed workflow format, FlowWeave is:
- **Open and Extensible**: JSON-based with clear schema definitions
- **Version Controlled**: Semantic versioning with migration support
- **Template-Based**: Reusable workflow templates with variable substitution

### 2. Dynamic Component Architecture
Components in AtlasWeave are:
- **Programmable**: Full TypeScript/JavaScript execution environment
- **Composable**: Components can be combined in complex ways
- **Versioned**: Independent component versioning and updates
- **Testable**: Built-in testing frameworks for component validation

### 3. Advanced Expression Engine
The expression engine provides:
- **Full JavaScript Support**: Execute complex business logic
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic value substitution with `{{variable.path}}`
- **Conditional Logic**: Advanced if-then-else with nested conditions
- **Data Transformation**: Built-in map, filter, reduce operations

### 4. Enterprise Integration
AtlasWeave integrates deeply with enterprise systems:
- **Multi-System Orchestration**: Coordinate actions across dozens of systems
- **Transactional Semantics**: ACID-like guarantees for multi-step operations
- **Error Recovery**: Sophisticated retry and rollback mechanisms
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance

## Use Cases

### 1. User Lifecycle Management
```json
{
  "name": "Complete User Onboarding",
  "steps": [
    "Fetch HR Data",
    "Create AD Account",
    "Assign O365 License",
    "Setup AWS Access",
    "Invite to Slack",
    "Send Welcome Email"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Access Control Automation
```json
{
  "name": "Department Transfer",
  "steps": [
    "Update AD Group Membership",
    "Modify AWS IAM Policies",
    "Reassign O365 Licenses",
    "Update Slack Channels",
    "Notify Manager"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Compliance & Auditing
```json
{
  "name": "Access Review Process",
  "steps": [
    "Identify Stale Accounts",
    "Generate Review Tasks",
    "Send Approval Requests",
    "Process Decisions",
    "Update Systems",
    "Log Compliance Events"
  ]
}
```

## CLI Tools

AtlasWeave includes powerful CLI tools for workflow management:

```bash
# Validate a FlowWeave document
flowweave validate workflow.json

# Execute a workflow
flowweave run workflow.json user-onboarding

# List available components
flowweave list-components

# Convert visual design to FlowWeave
flowweave convert-canvas design.json workflow.json
```

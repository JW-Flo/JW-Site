**Strategic Alignment:**
Infrastructure planning and resource provisioning are aligned with authoritative market and technical research. For context and rationale, see:

- [COMPREHENSIVE_ATLASIT_INDUSTRY_RESEARCH_REPORT.md](../COMPREHENSIVE_ATLASIT_INDUSTRY_RESEARCH_REPORT.md) — Professional market intelligence, competitive analysis, and strategic recommendations
- [ATLASIT_MARKET_RESEARCH_REPORT.md](../ATLASIT_MARKET_RESEARCH_REPORT.md) — Small business IT automation market sizing, competitive gaps, and platform feature recommendations

All infrastructure decisions and future automation are referenced to these reports. Please consult them for justification and ongoing strategic alignment.

Planned resources:

- cloudflare_pages_project (jw-site)
- cloudflare_kv_namespace (visits / rate limiting)
- cloudflare_d1_database (guestbook)
- (Optional) secrets (refer to dashboard for Turnstile keys)

Notes:

- R2 removed (cost optimization)
- For now, manual creation via wrangler / dashboard; Terraform stub kept for future automation.

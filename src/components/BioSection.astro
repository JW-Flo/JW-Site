        I've always carried a strong sense of responsibility to protect the people and systems around me. Growing up in an orphanage in Kiev taught me resilience and self-reliance — traits that carried forward into my childhood in the U.S. After six years in South Carolina and ten in Nebraska, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout, an early milestone in discipline and leadership.

        At eighteen, I joined the U.S. Army and deployed to Afghanistan, leading a team through high-pressure missions. I turned 20 during my deployment in Jalalabad and celebrated my 21st birthday on a layover in Dublin on the flight home, where I had my first Guinness. The military reinforced the value of structure and reliability — making sure that the people and tools you depend on can be counted on when it matters most.

        When I transitioned into civilian life, I wanted to apply that same mindset to technology. I started in logistics, moving hardware and coordinating inventory, but I spent my nights studying networking and earning certifications like the CCNA. That opened the door to IT and systems engineering, where I learned the nuts and bolts of infrastructure. Over time, I realized my drive wasn't just about keeping things running — it was about keeping them secure.

      <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
        Outside of work, I stay curious. I've explored AI-driven security automation, early quantum computing concepts, and built AtlasIT, a lightweight automated IT management platform designed to push identity workflows and provisioning as far as possible without human overhead.

        I'm an avid outdoors enthusiast who loves staying active. I paddleboard regularly, enjoying the peaceful waters and the mental clarity it brings. Hiking with my dog Sasha is one of my favorite ways to unwind - we've explored countless trails together, from local parks to more challenging mountain paths. I also enjoy biking and running, which help me maintain balance and stay energized for both work and personal adventures.

        One of my most memorable experiences was a 48-state, 80-day road trip across the US. It was an incredible journey of discovery, meeting amazing people, and experiencing the diverse beauty of our country firsthand. These adventures remind me that the best solutions often come from stepping outside your comfort zone and approaching challenges from fresh perspectives.

        Looking back, my path has been about progression: from Kiev to the Army, from logistics to IT, from IT to security, and now from security to automation. What drives me isn't titles or tools, but the responsibility to protect and improve — a thread that began in my earliest years and continues to guide my work today.

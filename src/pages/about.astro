  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About</h1>
  <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-300 mb-4">I am a cybersecurity engineer who enjoys building lean, automatable defenses. I believe security engineering must be measurable, approachable, and aligned with real operational risk—not fear. Outside of securing systems, I’m currently completing a 48‑state roadtrip documenting energy efficiency, weather impact, and journey analytics.</p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-300 mb-4">I value high-signal processes, clear service boundaries, and investing in tooling that shrinks mean-time-to-detect and mean-time-to-remediate. I learn by shipping.</p>
  <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-300">When not working or driving, I capture photography, refine the telemetry platform, and write about practical security approaches that balance constraints with resilience.</p>

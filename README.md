# Personal Site – Joe Whittle

Static, low-maintenance cybersecurity engineering portfolio + human journey context.

## Stack

- Astro + MDX
- TailwindCSS
- Cloudflare Pages (primary hosting)

## Local Development

### Option 1: Native Node.js (Recommended for development)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Site at <http://localhost:4321>

### Option 2: Docker (For consistent environments)

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
npm run dev:docker

# Or manually:
docker-compose up

# Or build and run separately:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

Site at <http://localhost:4321>

#### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev:docker

# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Start in background
npm run docker:up

# Stop containers
npm run docker:down
```

Docker provides a consistent development environment across different machines and ensures all dependencies are properly isolated.

## Content Updates

- Resume: edit `src/data/resume.json`.
- Blog posts: add new `.mdx` files under `src/pages/blog/` with frontmatter.
- Projects: update array in `src/pages/projects.astro` (or later move to data file).

## Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

You can deploy either through the Cloudflare Pages UI or locally with Wrangler.

### One-time (UI)

1. Create a new Pages project, point at this repo (or upload zip of `dist`).
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Output directory: `dist`
4. Set env var `SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.tld` (no trailing slash) once domain is known.
5. After first deploy, add any custom domain; trigger a redeploy so canonical URLs + feeds update.

### Local (Wrangler CLI)

Build then deploy:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy:preview   # preview branch deploy
npm run deploy           # production deploy
```

During development you can iterate on the already-built output (rarely needed) with:

```bash
npm run pages:dev
```

Historical note: GitHub Pages was the initial fallback; canonical generation now expects `SITE_URL` to be set for production.

### Staging Workflow

Use a `staging` branch for pre-production validation:

1. Push feature branches & open PRs – CI builds preview deployments (Cloudflare Pages preview environment).
2. Merge into `staging` – automatic staging deploy (configure Cloudflare project to map branch `staging` to staging URL).
3. Final QA on staging URL (security headers, APIs, structured data).
4. Merge staging → main for production deploy.

### Auth (Wrangler OAuth Recommended)

Fast path:

```bash
npm run auth:login
```

What the script does: unsets any `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (so Wrangler doesn't force token mode) then launches the browser OAuth flow (`wrangler login`). Credentials are stored under `~/.wrangler`.

Manual steps if you prefer:

```bash
unset CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
npx wrangler login
wrangler whoami
```

If you previously exported a token in your shell profile, remove that line and re-source it before logging in. Avoid pasting API tokens into commits or chat.

## Principles

- Minimal attack surface (static output only)
- Single JSON resume source of truth
- No backend, no database
- Simple, readable code

## Minimal Maintenance Cheatsheet

Add a blog post:

1. Create `src/pages/blog/my-post.mdx`
2. Include frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My Post Title
description: Short one-line description.
pubDate: 2025-08-27
---

Content here.
```

1. Commit & push – feed & sitemap update automatically.

Update resume:

1. Edit `src/data/resume.json`
2. Commit & push.

Change canonical domain later:

1. Update `SITE_URL` env var (Cloudflare Pages > Settings > Environment Variables or wrangler.toml vars).
2. Trigger new deploy.

Customize metadata: edit `src/data/siteMeta.ts`.

Things intentionally removed (simplicity):

- Automated JSON schema validation
- MCP settings generator (static file in `public/.well-known/`)
- CI workflow & lint dependencies

Future (optional):

- Dark/light toggle
- Tag filtering for blog
- Reintroduce linting or content validation if needed

## Smoke Tests

Simple script to hit key endpoints (run while dev server is up):

```bash
chmod +x scripts/smoke.sh # first run
./scripts/smoke.sh http://localhost:4321
```

## API Endpoints (Current)

- `GET /api/guestbook` – recent guestbook entries
- `POST /api/guestbook` – add entry (Turnstile token required)
- `GET /api/guestbook/stats` – counts & latest entries
- `GET /api/geo` – Cloudflare edge geo metadata (rate limited)
- `GET /api/waitlist` – waitlist count (feature-flag: `FEATURE_WAITLIST`)
- `POST /api/waitlist` – join waitlist (feature-flag: `FEATURE_WAITLIST`)

### Admin Consent Metrics Portal

An intentionally unlinked, low-noise admin view for aggregated consent preferences to validate privacy UX and regional gating. Accessible at:

- Page: `/admin-consent`
- Backend API: `GET /api/admin/consent-stats`

Authentication:

Provide a single header `X-Admin-Key: <secret>` (value must match environment variable `CONSENT_ADMIN_KEY`). If the header is missing or incorrect, the API returns `404` (not `401/403`) to avoid advertising its presence.

What you see:

- Totals of consent_events rows (overall + analytics, research, marketing opt-ins)
- 25 most recent consent events (session fragment, country, individual flags)
- CSV export of the currently displayed recent events (client‑side only)

Enabling:

1. In Cloudflare Pages project > Settings > Environment Variables add a variable `CONSENT_ADMIN_KEY` with a sufficiently strong random value (>= 24 chars). Do NOT commit the value to `wrangler.toml`.
2. Redeploy. The page will then respond once the correct header is supplied.

Operational Tips:

- Rotate the key periodically; simply update the Pages variable and redeploy.
- Because the page is discoverable if someone enumerates routes, its source sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow"/>` and a generic title. Treat security as relying on possession of the header secret, not obscurity.
- Consider adding IP-based rate limiting in front of `/api/admin/consent-stats` later (currently small attack surface; returns 404 quickly on mismatch).
- If you temporarily want to disable access, unset `CONSENT_ADMIN_KEY` and redeploy (API will always 404; UI shows Not found).

Data Source:

Rows originate from the `consent_events` D1 table created in migration `001_consent_events.sql`. Ensure feature flag `FEATURE_CONSENT_D1` (if used) and migrations are applied so events are being inserted.

Client Behavior:

- The page stores the provided key only for the current tab session via `sessionStorage` (cleared on tab close).
- No key is logged or persisted server-side.

Threat Model Notes:

- Wrong key: indistinguishable from missing endpoint (404).
- Brute force: improbable success before rotation if key sufficiently random; add WAF/rate limits if risk appetite demands.
- Leakage: avoid pasting key into shared screenshots; use the password field provided.

To remove the portal entirely, delete `src/pages/admin-consent.astro` and redeploy.

Key Rotation Helper:

Rotate + set new admin key locally:

```bash
npm run rotate:consent-admin-key            # prints new key & sets secret (no deploy)
npm run rotate:consent-admin-key -- --deploy # rotate + build + deploy
npm run rotate:consent-admin-key -- --dry-run # show what would happen
```

Store the printed key immediately; it cannot be retrieved later. A rotation only becomes active after deployment.

### Waitlist Feature

The optional early‑access waitlist is disabled by default and gated by the environment variable `FEATURE_WAITLIST`.

Enable locally (ephemeral) via shell:

```bash
FEATURE_WAITLIST=true npm run dev
```

Or set in Cloudflare Pages project settings (Environment Variables) for preview / production.

Apply database migration (creates `waitlist_signups` table):

```bash
# Local (uses local D1 instance)
npm run db:migrate:local

# Remote (production binding)
npm run db:migrate
```

Schema (migration `002_waitlist.sql`):

```sql
CREATE TABLE waitlist_signups (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	source TEXT,
	marketing_consent INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
	ip_hash TEXT,
	hash_algo TEXT
);
```

Privacy: IP addresses are one‑way hashed with a secret (same mechanism as geo consent hashing) before storage; no raw IPs are retained. Duplicate joins return `{ ok: true, duplicate: true }` without error for smoother UX.

Widget: Renders only when `FEATURE_WAITLIST` is `true` (see `src/components/WaitlistWidget.astro`).

The previous `/demo` section has been retired. Requests to `/demo` return a 410 page. All functionality now under `/api/*`.

## Enhanced Security Scanner – Session & Consent

The enhanced scanner issues a short-lived signed session cookie (`escan_s`) strictly for grouping a visitor's scans (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax). It contains only a random ID + signature. Signing uses `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` (configure as secret in Cloudflare Pages). No personal identifiers are embedded.

### Minimal Metadata Packets (KV `SCANNER_META`)

Each scan may generate a tiny JSON packet (<= ~250 bytes):

```json
{ "u": "...", "t": 1735690000000, "m": "business", "f": 12, "c": 2, "s": 87, "co": "US", "ua": "ab12cd" }
```

Field summary:

- `u` – origin + truncated path (no query, no full URL leak)
- `t` – timestamp (ms)
- `m` – mode (business | engineer | super-admin-lite)
- `f` – total findings
- `c` – critical/high finding count
- `s` – overall score (if computed)
- `co` – country code (only with research consent)
- `ua` – one-way hashed User-Agent (only with research consent)

### Consent Gating

Persistence occurs ONLY if a consent cookie `cc_prefs` indicates:

- Analytics: `a:1` OR Research: `r:1`
- Research implies analytics (adds `co` & `ua` fields)

No consent => No metadata persisted (scan still runs; results returned directly).

### Regional Compliance

Client code (cookie banner / CMP) must refrain from setting analytics/research consent values until explicit opt-in for users in regulated jurisdictions (EU GDPR, California). The server trusts the presence/absence of flags – ensure geo + consent logic on the client is correct.

### Environment & Bindings

- KV binding `SCANNER_META` (placeholder IDs in `wrangler.toml`) – replace with real namespace IDs.
- Secret: `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` (HMAC signing).

### Creating the `SCANNER_META` KV Namespace

The binding is currently commented out to allow deployment without a real namespace. When ready to enable persistence:

1. Create production + preview namespaces:

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create SCANNER_META --env=production
wrangler kv:namespace create SCANNER_META --env=preview
```

1. Copy the returned `id` and `preview_id` values into `wrangler.toml` under an uncommented block:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "SCANNER_META"
id = "<prod-id>"
preview_id = "<preview-id>"
```

1. Redeploy. The scanner will begin persisting consent-gated packets.

1. (Optional) To inspect a few recent keys during development:

```bash
wrangler kv:key list --namespace-id <preview-id> | head
```

1. To purge old data manually (normally TTL handles this):

```bash
wrangler kv:key delete --namespace-id <prod-id> <key>
```

Keep namespace small; avoid adding user-identifiable data.

### Data Retention & Size

- KV entries TTL: 24h (lightweight aggregate trend window)
- No IP addresses persisted; no exact full URLs; no raw user agents.

### Extensibility

Future analytics dashboards can query aggregated counts without exposing personal data. Any schema expansion must go through updated consent documentation before deployment.

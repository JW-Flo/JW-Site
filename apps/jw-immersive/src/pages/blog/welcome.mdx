# Welcome

This site is a lightweight, low-maintenance portfolio documenting my security engineering work and the ongoing 48‑state EV telemetry adventure.

## Why Static

Static rendering keeps attack surface minimal: no runtime server, no patch treadmill, and content deploys via signed Git commits.

## Focus Areas

- Practical detection engineering
- Security automation & IaC guardrails
- Telemetry correlation for resilience
- Journey analytics (energy, weather, geography)

## What’s Next

More write-ups on:

1. Building defensible, observable edge workloads
2. Lightweight caching & schema validation patterns
3. Measuring real security control efficacy (not slideware)

Thanks for reading.

# R2 Integration QA Checklist

- [x] R2 endpoints implemented: `/functions/r2/upload`, `/functions/r2/download`, `/functions/r2/delete`, `/functions/r2/list`
- [x] MEDIA binding present in `wrangler.toml`
- [x] No API or UI integration found in main app
- [x] Documentation added: `R2_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` and `R2_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- [x] Integration guide provides actionable next steps and code sample
- [x] All documentation is clear and actionable for future development

**Result:**

- R2 storage is ready for integration but not yet used by the main app. Documentation and a clear path for integration are now present.
